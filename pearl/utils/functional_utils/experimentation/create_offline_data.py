    """
    This function creates offline data by interacting with a given environment using a specified
    agent. This is mostly for illustration with standard benchmark environments. For most
    practical use cases, offline data collection will use custom pipelines.

    Transition tuples are stored in .pt file in the specified path. Training returns
    (episodic returns during training) of the agent are saved in a pickle file. At the end of data
    collection, evaluation returns of the final agent are also saved in a pickle file. This
    approximates the performance of the best learned policy in the offline data.

    Note: Much of this function overlaps with `run_episode` function in
        `pearl/utils/functional_utils/train_and_eval/online_learning.py`.

    Args:
        agent (PearlAgent): A pearl agent with policy learner, exploration module and replay buffer
            specified. For e.g. a DQN agent.
        env (Environment): An environment to collect data from (e.g. `GymEnvironment`).
        save_path (str): Path to save the offline data.
        file_name (str): Name of the file to save the raw transition tuples.
        max_len_offline_data (int): Number of the transition tuples to be collected in offline data.
        learn (bool): When set to True, the agent learns after each environment interaction.
            Defaults to True.
        exploit (bool): When set to True, the agent does not explore and acts greedily with respect
            to the current estimate of the optimal policy. Defaults to False as we want the agent
            to explore during data collection for standard benchmarks.
        learn_after_episode (bool): When set to True, the agent learns after each episode.
            Defaults to False.
        evaluation_episodes (int): The number of episodes to evaluate the trained agent on.
            Defaults to 100.
        seed (int, optional): Environment seed for reproducibility.

    Returns:
        returns_offline_agent: a list of returns for each evaluation episode.
