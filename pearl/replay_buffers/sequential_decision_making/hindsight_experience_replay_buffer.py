    final mode for alternative only for now

    TLDR:
    HindsightExperienceReplayBuffer is used for sparse reward problems.
    After an episode ends, apart from pushing original data in,
    it will replace original goal with final state in the episode,
    and replay the transitions again for new rewards and push

    capacity: size of the replay buffer
    goal_dim: dimension of goal of the problem. as input to push API will be the final state representation
              so, it is already a cat among eg position in sparse reward environment + goal
              we could need this info in order to split alternative goal after episode terminates
    reward_fn: is the F here: F(state+goal, action) = reward
    done_fn: This is different from paper. Original paper doesnt have it. We need it for games which may end earlier
              If this is not defined, then use done value from original trajectory.
